Description: A collection of functions that primarily produce graphics to
    aid in a Propensity Score Analysis (PSA).  Functions include: cat.psa
    and box.psa to test balance within strata of categorical and
    quantitative covariates, circ.psa for a representation of the
    estimated effect size by stratum, loess.psa that provides a graphic
    and loess based effect size estimate, and various balance functions
    that provide measures of the balance achieved via a PSA in a
    categorical covariate.
