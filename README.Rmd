A collection of functions that primarily produce graphics to aid in a Propensity Score Analysis (PSA). Functions include: cat.psa and box.psa to test balance within strata of categorical and quantitative covariates, circ.psa for a representation of the estimated effect size by stratum, loess.psa that provides a graphic and loess based effect size estimate, and various balance functions that provide measures of the balance achieved via a PSA in a categorical covariate.
